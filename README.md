# Web Design Module

![Design preview for the Shortly URL shortening API coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this landing page, integrate with the [rel.ink](https://rel.ink) API and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Shorten any valid URL
- See a list of their shortened links, even after refreshing the browser
- Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  
## Technical requirements
- Your design must be [mobile first](https://medium.com/@Vincentxia77/what-is-mobile-first-design-why-its-important-how-to-make-it-7d3cf2e29d00)
- You must make use of [fexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) and/or [css grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/)
- You must use a style compiler tool such as [sass](https://sass-lang.com/), [less](http://lesscss.org/), [stylus](https://stylus-lang.com/), etc.

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design to work to along with active states.

The designs are in JPG static format. This will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. This should help train your eye to perceive differences in spacings and sizes.

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

## Building your project

Practice using version control by creating your own GitHub repository for this challenge. This has the added benefit of being able to publish the site for free on GitHub Pages. Find out more about GitHub Pages here: [https://pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com).

Another great tool you could use to get your website live is [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com). They offer a very simple and intuitive way of deploying a site for free and linking the live version to your Git repository.

## Suggested workflow

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:

1. Initialize your project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/). This will make it easier to share your code with the community if you need some help. If you're not sure how to do this, [have a read through of this Try Git resource](https://try.github.io/).
2. Configure your repository to publish your code to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).
3. Look through the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes that you could create to make reusable styles.
4. Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.
5. Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
6. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.
